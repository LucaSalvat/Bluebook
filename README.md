# Bluebook

This project has the aim to create a LaTex pacakge able to hold and produce a Bluebook citation style, style used in the specific legla citation style ofr american law.
Due to my inexpirience in programming in latex those codes are inefficent and very disfunctional, so any suggestion that cna improve the project would be useful.
