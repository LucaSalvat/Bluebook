# Bluebook

This project has the aim to create a LaTex pacakge able to hold and produce a Bluebook citation style, style used in the specific legla citation style ofr american law.
Due to my inexpirience in programming in latex those codes are inefficent and very disfunctional, so any suggestion that cna improve the project would be useful. 

## Initila work
For now i tried to replicate the journal article (consecutively paginated and non consecutively pagineted - periodic) and the newspaper, i have also tried to implement a possible automatation to reduce to display the authros (of two with &, if three the first + et.al) and an autmatation to reduce simplifiy the months. 

All the citation for now are produced as footnotes, but i hope will be expanded as endnotes and as bibliography.
